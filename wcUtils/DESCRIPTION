Description: The aim of `wcUtils` is to make your life as
    an analyst of Wildlife Computers data a wee bit easier.
    You do need a rudimentary understanding of R and the
    package does require the R package 'reshape' (available
    on CRAN). At this point, the purpose of \code{wcUtils}
    is to make your life easier, not to do the analysis for
    you. As such, the tools focus more on manipulation of
    data and less on analysis.
