#' Makes life easier for those working with Wildlife Computers data
#'
#' The aim of `wcUtils` is to make your life as an analyst of Wildlife Computers data 
#' a wee bit easier. You do need a rudimentary understanding of R and the package does 
#' require the R package 'reshape' (available on CRAN). At this point, the purpose of 
#' \code{wcUtils} is to make your life easier, not to do the analysis for you. As such, 
#' the tools focus more on manipulation of data and less on analysis.
