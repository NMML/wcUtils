RTC Temp-Compensation table is not implemented

Sample:
     Depth: every 10 seconds
     Temperature: every 10 seconds
     Light Level: every 10 seconds
     Battery Voltage: never
     Wet/Dry Sensor: every 10 seconds
Data will be archived regardless of wet/dry state

Maximum-depth histograms are enabled with 10 bins:
2, 4, 10, 20, 50, 76, 100, 150, 200, >200m

Dive-duration histograms are enabled with 10 bins:
30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 300, 360, >360sec

Time-at-Temperature histograms are enabled with 10 bins:
-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, >8C

Time-at-Depth histograms are enabled with 12 bins:
0, 2, 4, 10, 20, 50, 76, 100, 150, 200, 250, >250m

Maximum-Depth and Dive-Duration histograms only record dives deeper than 2m
Dive-Duration histograms are determined by time deeper than 2m
Histograms are compiled over 6-hour periods sampling every 10seconds, starting at 02:00
1-hour percentage timelines are enabled.  Threshold = wet/dry
Histograms and timelines are transmitted to the satellite every 45 sec when the tag is at-sea
and every 90 sec when the tag is on-land.
The tag changes from at-sea mode to on-land mode when it has been dry for at least 30
out of 60 seconds for 7 minutes.
The tag will stop transmitting once it has been on-land for 4 hours
The tag changes from on-land mode to at-sea mode when it has been wet for at least 30
out of 60 seconds, whether stopped or not.
The tag continues to transmit histograms and timelines for 2 days after the data are collected

If possible, several histograms or timelines will be combined to form a 12-byte Argos transmission
Short Status Messages will be transmitted
